# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification with ResNet18 (PyTorch)

This project uses a fine-tuned ResNet18 model from PyTorch to classify brain MRI images into four categories:

- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary**
- **No Tumor**

It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, loss visualization, and model saving.
